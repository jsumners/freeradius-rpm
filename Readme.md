# Freeradius (upstream) RPM

This repository contains a simple build script for creating RHEL RPMs from
the upstream release package. The build script has been tested in RHEL 7.1.

RPMs generated by this script will start with "freeradis-us" instead of just
"freeradius". This is done so that you can differentiate the RPMs from this
build script and the official RPMs.
